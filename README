Hey Tumblr, Quit Messing With The Dashboard
By Bjorn Stromberg

I don't know if you're anything like me, but I'm sick of all the junk Tumblr is cramming onto the side of the dashboard. So I made this Chrome Extension to rein in the out of control Tumblr dashboard.

You can customize this to only hide certain sections of the dashboard. Just enter in the sections you want to remove in the options page and you're good to go.
